The dataset underwent testing using a clustering algorithm with a tolerance of 0.13 on the transition matrix of the Markov chain, derived from the current state to the next state

The clustering algorithm identified 5 clusters: {A1, A2, A3, A4}, {A5}, {A6, A7}, {A8, A9, A10}, {A11}. The diagonally dominant coupling matrix can help indicates clustering, 
the cluster have average diagonal entries is 0.9284 

After obtaining the clusters, the conclusions drawn are as follows:

1. Stocks within the same class tend to pause their closing price movements within their respective clusters. For instance, when dealing with class ùê¥1, the closing price 
movement is likely to pause in either ùê¥1, A2, A3, or A4.

2. Therefore, for consistent and secure profits in BBCA stocks, it is recommended to execute buy and sell transactions when the closing prices align within the same cluster.

3. On the other hand, for those seeking higher returns with increased risk in BBCA stocks, engaging in stock transactions when the closing prices fall into different clusters is advised
